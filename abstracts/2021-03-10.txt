TITLE: Sum Systems

ABSTRACT: Many fields of mathematics are born from simple, yet, potent
questions. The study of Sum Systems comes from such; given a natural number n,
can you find two sets such that by taking every combinations of sums between
elements of the two sets you get each value 0, 1, 2,..., n uniquely? This talk
will be an introduction to the field of Sum Systems, some of their inheritance
properties, and some of the most recent developments in the area - namely; for
any natural number n, how many possible sum systems correspond to it?
