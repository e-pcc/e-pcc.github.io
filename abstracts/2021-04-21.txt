TITLE: Trees and tree-like structures in dense digraphs

ABSTRACT: A spanning structure in a (directed) graph is one obtained by
deleting edges or arcs (but no vertices). In general, no efficient
algorithm is known which detects a given spanning structure in an
arbitrary graph or directed graph (as in the travelling salesman
problem). Hence it is natural to look for sufficient conditions
which guarantee the presence of certain spanning structures.
Indeed, many classical results (and longstanding conjectures)
have this form.

We discuss some recent advances and open problems in this area,
focusing on spanning structures of digraphs of high semidegree
(i.e., in which each vertex has a large number of in- and
outneighbours). Joint work with Richard Mycroft.
