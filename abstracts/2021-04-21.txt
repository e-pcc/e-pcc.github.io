TITLE: Trees and tree-like structures in dense digraphs

ABSTRACT: A spanning structure in a (directed) graph is one obtained by deleting 
(arcs) edges, but no vertices. In general, no efficient algorithm is known
which finds a given spanning structure in a graph or directed graph 
(think travelling salesman problem). It is then is natural to look for 
sufficient conditions which guarantee the presence of certain classes
of spanning structures, and indeed many classical results 
(and longstanding conjectures) have this form.

We discuss some recent advances and open problems in this area, focusing 
on spanning structures of digraphs in which each vertex has a large number 
of in- and neighbours. Joint work with Richard Mycroft.
